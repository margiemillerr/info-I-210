      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Brownsburg</b> is 25-30 minutes almost immediately west of
        Indianapolis. It used to be really small, but construction over the past
        several years has made the number of buildings and the number of people
        living there go up <em>so</em> much. We have a really good school system
        and a variety of <em>amazing</em> small businesses, and those are
        typically what attract people there.

        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <p>
          The weather is usually <b>awful</b>. Whatever the temperature is in
          the rest of the state, Brownsburg feels it 10x more. Storms tend to
          cut in half and move around us, though, which is nice.
