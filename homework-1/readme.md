## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

From my understanding, **web applications** are like a giant pool of sites and information. **Websites** are just the specific piece of the pool you are looking for. An example of a web application would be google, because it is a big server full of smaller websites you can reach.

### VS Code & Extensions

**VS Code** is the program we use to do web development. I've used it before in a front end development class to make websites and submit them to an external, public server called CyberDuck. The **extensions** are essentially the helpers that act like an autocorrect. They're shortcuts that help make future projects easier to make and correct.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

I don't know much about **Git/GitHub**, other than learning it will make things a lot easier and a lot more convenient when submitting projects and such in the future. From what I've noticed, it seems to work smoothly within VS Code without requiring too much (if anything) after set up.

### Markdown & Documentation

**Markdowns** are the plug-ins for adding different punctuation, text styles, or formatting for text. It can add bold/italics, create tables, or make ordered lists. These can make overall organization and style of the text more fluid and easy to understand.
